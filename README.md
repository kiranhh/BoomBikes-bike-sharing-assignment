# BoomBikes-bike-sharing-assignment

## Project Name : Boombikes-LinearRegression-Assignment
Linear Regression performed on the Boombikes bike rental dataset as part of an assignment for coursework in the course Executive PG in Machine Learning and AI from IIIT Bangalore.


## General Information
Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
The project is done as part of coursework in the Machine Learning module.
We are trying to find the number of rentals issued from the company based on numerous independent values such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc.
The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.

## Conclusions
The major steps included in the python notebook are data interpretation, data visualisation, data pre-processing, model training, feature selection, residual analysis, model evaluation on the test set.
Concepts such as EDA, p-value, VIF, RFE were used and model building was done using statsmodels library
